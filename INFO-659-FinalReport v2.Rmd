__Introduction__

The selected Dataset consists of employee details who voluntarily resigned in 2016 from the employer: IBM.
This collection of information also gives us a holistic view of employee records, which could have paved path to their attrition with the organization.

It has been the industry’s best practice that every organization is encouraged to permit ‘Good Attrition’ while they should be equally cautious and mindful of the ‘Bad Attrition’ which causes enormous loss in terms of employee experience and ultimately revenue generation.

__Problem Statement__

To identify the factors contributing to uncontrolled ‘Bad Attrition’ in this case and predict the key factors in bringing the overall attrition rate under control.

__Project Objectives__

To come up with a robust predictable model which will help in understanding the most common reasons of attrition for the employees, in order to control the attrition rate.

•	Identify the key contributors of Attrition 

•	Identify Good & Bad attrition rate

•	Apply stages of Data Analytics lifecycle & its processes

•	Observations made & Measures for employer to arrest the uncontrolled attrition

__Data sources and data preparation__

The dataset that we are using in this project has been pulled from Kaggle.

__Data Exploration, visualization, cleansing and transformation__

_Data Exploration_ - Multiple combination of attributes have been tested in order find the best correlated variables. The same can be seen in the below code in Modeling section.

_Cleansing_ - Extensive validation of data revealed no anomalies. Dataset didn't include any nulls or NAN values and hence the scope of cleansing has been reduced for this dataset.

_Transformation_ - Transformed string to numeric values for specific attributes, to suit the modelling.

In order to obtain the correlation between the attributes, we’ve been required to change few numeric variables to alphabetical values.

Attrition = (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
Business Travel = (0 = Non-Travel, 1 = Travel Rarely, 2 = Travel Frequently)
Gender = (1 = Male, 2 = Female)
Marital Status = (1 = Single, 2 = Married, 3 = Divorced)
Overtime = (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
Result = (0 = Bad, 1 = Good)

__Methodology__

We have tried applying Logistic Regression Model, Naïve Bayes Model and Decision Tree Model for analyzing and predicting.

After observing the Kappa, Accuracy, Sensitivity and Recall values along with the F ratio, we have arrived at the conclusion of utilizing Decision Tree as the best suitable model for our data.

table(test$Attrition, relation1_log>0.3)
```


__Evaluation__

Below are the evaluation metrics obtained from all the three different models that have been attempted on the current dataset. We can observe that the results with decision tree model seems promising.

![](Evaluation.PNG)


__Major Challenges__
•	As we are using the sample function to randomly generate the test and train data, evaluation values for the models kept on changing as we make multiple attempts in executing the code.

•	Key parameters such as Last Working Day of the employee was not present in the list, due to which we were unable to understand the exact Attrition reason. While we did overcome this challenge by considering the industry standards as published in the recent HR Journals (Attrition Types such as: Attrition by Billing rate, Overtime, Training, Pay revision, Stock-options & by job Promotion).

•	Also, Primary & Secondary reasons for an employee resignation has not been captured in the dataset, which limits us from further analyzing the situation for every employee who did choose to resign/get separated from the Organization.

_Key Finding_ 
•	Higher correlation amongst the variables resulted in higher accuracy and Kappa values.


__Conclusion and future work__

With the chosen limited dataset, we were able to evaluate the Attrition details to a certain extent using the available variables & employee information. During the Project accomplishments, it is learnt that the attrition rate is beyond the defined industry standard of (15% – 18%) as compared with Service based IT firms.

Due to the uncontrolled Attrition rate as seen in this case, Revenue leakage / loss in terms of investing learning Hours & on-board the successor is anticipated. It is hard to engage Clients of New Business without a consistent average of talents in the firm, relevant experience in a chosen skill.

The Metrics which reveal better observations are listed below:
1. Employee friendly, Employee experience for a stable work environment
2. Last Working Day
3. Employee Index
4. Performance Management

Enhanced model can be built upon adding more attributes and instances to this dataset. Algorithms to achieve greater accurate results can be programed using the present methods advanced.
